Here's a pointwise explanation of the given Python code that checks whether a number `n` is prime:

### Function Definition
```python
def is_prime(n):
```
- This line defines a function named `is_prime` that takes one argument `n`, which is the number to be checked for primality.

### Check for Numbers Less Than or Equal to 1
```python
    if n <= 1:
        return False
```
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it immediately returns `False` because prime numbers are defined as greater than 1.

### Loop Through Potential Divisors
```python
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
```
- This loop iterates over all integers `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` (rounded down to the nearest integer). 
  - The square root is used because a larger factor of `n` would necessarily have a corresponding smaller factor that would have been checked already, making it redundant to check beyond the square root.
  - `int(n**0.5)+1` ensures the range includes the integer part of the square root of `n`.

### Check Divisibility
```python
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
```
- Inside the loop, the code checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). 
  - If `n` is divisible by any `i` in this range, it means `n` is not a prime number, so the function immediately returns `False`.

### Return True if No Divisors Found
```python
    return True
```
- If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Summary
1. The function first handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or less.
2. It then checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.
3. If any divisor is found, it returns `False` (not prime).
4. If no divisors are found, it returns `True` (prime).

This is an efficient way to check for primality, especially for moderately large numbers.
